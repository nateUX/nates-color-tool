# Parametric Color Generator
Creates scales from a base color value and increment value.

This little app (built on Electron) was inspired by a blog post from UXPin CEO, Marcin Treder regarding defining a more structured color palette for their product. That post can be read here [One Color Palette to Rule them All](https://medium.com/@marcintreder/design-system-sprint-2-one-color-palette-to-rule-them-all-d0114ed1f659).

In that post he mentions a quick tool he built, with Electron, for a simple task of generating colors based on a base value and an increment. Seemed simple enough, so I gave it a shot as well. This bit repo is a product of that effort.
